This file has no functionality. It just describes planned features and guidelines.

1. Keep this bot as generalized as possible. Ideally everything works on any server, no hard coded channel IDs etc.
2. Create a config file which has all necessary startup parameters.

bot_client functions:
    rules DONE
    calc DONE
    help
    prefix
    random
