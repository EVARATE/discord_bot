# About this branch

*Why Python?* you may ask. *Why not stick to sleak, nice, fun, fast, efficient and legendary C++?*. Well I don't f\*cking know. Maybe because it took me several hours and OS reinstalls to set the b!tch up with no success. Maybe I just want all that stress out of my life.

This is an experiment after all. Maybe python can't deliver what I need. We'll see.

This branch is called *master* but that doesn't mean it is stable. There simply is no dev branch yet.

# About

This repository contains the source code to my discord bot. I have written it primarly to fit my own needs so others can't just use this code as is. There are functions that e.g. send messages to hard coded channel-IDs. If you really want to use this code and you don't know or don't want to go through all of it then we can talk about making it more accessible, no promises though.

## Branches

To get the lowest possibility of bugs and crashes then you should only use the master branch. I only commit code there if I at least feel like it is half stable, which doesn't mean that it is free of bugs or doesn't crash.

# Installation:

I don't fucking know. This is python. I'll have to figure it out first.

# External Resources:
 - Stress
 - Tears
