# About

Yo digga, das is ne ver√§nderung.

This repository contains the code to my discord bot. The bot can be added to any server but is mainly designed to
fit the needs of the server I'm on.

The `dev_python` branch contains the most up-to-date version of the bot but the chance of bugs is also highest.

The `master_python` branch contains a version which I have arbitrarily deemed stable.

## Dependencies
The following packages should be available via `pip` and are required:
 - discord.py
 - configparser
 
 Your python version should also be 3.6 or above.
 
 ## Setting up your bot
 I highly recommend running the server from some sort of terminal since important information will be displayed there.
 To start the bot run the `main.py` file. If you do that in a terminal you will see how it creates multiple files
 and directories. Open the `config.txt` file and fill in as many values as you have. Else, leave them as they are.
 Rerun `main.py`.
